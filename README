NAME:
  ABI Monitor - monitor new versions of a software library, try to build them and create profile for ABI Tracker: https://github.com/lvc/abi-tracker
  
  The tool is intended to be used with the ABI Tracker tool to visualize API/ABI changes timeline of a C/C++ library.
  
  The tool is developed by Andrey Ponomarenko: http://abi-laboratory.pro/

INSTALL:
  sudo make install prefix=/usr

REQUIRES:
  Perl 5 (5.8 or newer)
  GNU Wget
  CMake
  Automake
  GCC
  G++
  Ctags

USAGE:
  abi-monitor [options] [profile]
  
  The input profile will be extended after execution. Then it can be passed
  to the ABI Tracker.

EXAMPLES:
  abi-monitor -get -build libssh.json
  abi-monitor -rebuild -v 0.7.0 libssh.json

PROFILE FORMAT:

{
  "Name":       "SHORT LIBRARY NAME",
  "SourceUrl":  "URL TO DOWNLOAD PACKAGES",
  "Git":        "GIT ADDRESS TO CLONE"
}

PROFILE EXAMPLE:

{
  "Name":       "libssh",
  "SourceUrl":  "https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files",
  "Git":        "http://git.libssh.org/projects/libssh.git"
}

ADV. OPTIONS:
You can set additional option "BuildScript" to define the path to the shell script that should be used to build packages. It will be executed inside the source tree of a package. The script should install the library to the output directory defined by the INSTALL_TO environment variable. The code should be compiled with the "-g -Og" GCC options.

If you just want to add some configure options then you can define the "Configure" option of the profile.

The other option "SourceDir" allows to index packages from a local directory instead of downloading them from "SourceUrl".

ADV. USAGE:
  For advanced usage, see output of --help option.
